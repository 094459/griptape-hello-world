## Griptape Demo

This repo contains code that is used in my blog post, [Getting gnarly with AI - a quick look at Griptape, an enterprise ready alternative to LangChain](https://dev.to/aws/getting-gnarly-with-ai-a-quick-look-at-griptape-an-enterprise-ready-alternative-to-langchain-4e0i)

Once you have created a virtual Python environment (mine was set to use 3.10.11) then install the Python dependencies by

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can then follow along in the post.
